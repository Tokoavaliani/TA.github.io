        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No visible deformation at the working load (+1350N and -135N)</li>
          <li>The structure fails at twice the working load</li>
          <li>The structure should consist of two symmetric halves</li>

        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>
          This project required careful planning and careful calculation. Most teams used a triangular design for their cantilever, however, we elected to
          use a Warren Truss instead. There was no particular reason for this beyond a desire to do things differently. Ultimately this wasn't the wisest 
          decision as our truss was far more complex than any other, and hence required more material and more sophisticated metalwork.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the process of designing the truss we produced both general and technical drawings, including focused drawings of each joint. As we
          prepared to manufacture the truss we evaluated every joint and member such that we could be certain in choosing the correct materials and joining 
          methods. Equally important was the need to find a design which would fail as close to the required load as possible. No sooner and no later. This 
          informed our decision making when desining joints and selecting bars of an appropriate size to carry load. We used a 20% safety factor to account 
          for flaws in the materials we were using and inaccuracies in our metal work.
          <br>
          <br>
          The manufacturing process involved extensive metalwork using an array of typical workshop tools and a mixture of sheet metal and angle metal bar.
          We also made use of numerous joining methods, the most common of which was rivetting.
          <br>
          <br>
          Ultimately our truss was able to bear the working load with only very small deformation. However, the truss failed well short of the
          2.7kN target. This was because our truss was not perfectly symmetric and so the vertical load created transverse torsion and led to
          failure. Our truss was also much heavier and more complex than most, but outperformed all but one competitor in the loading test.
