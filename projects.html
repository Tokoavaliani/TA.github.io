                I love website design and wanted to create a personal wesbite, principally as a 'digital CV'. I decided it would be a fun
                project to pursue after a boss of mine encouraged me to cut my CV down to a one-pager and remove details on coursework.

                In this python based computing coursework I analysed time series data, primarily using the Least Squares method from Linear Algebra,
                and evaluated the performance of my models using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Sum of Square Error (SSE) techniques. I carried out Fourier 
                Analysis to capture and model periodic trends in the datasets and used this to create improved 'combined fit' models.

                  software subteam, producing code to handle navigation logic, 'line-following' and inputs from peripherals.

                  An extention to a series of short labs built around the theme of buildings in earthquakes 
                  and structures as linear systems. I chose to investigate the impact of using multiple 
                  tuned mass dampers when attempting to reduce the amplitude of vibrations of a system
                  at resonance. I created a python simulation programme, modified to run every potential
                  combination of parameters, with recursion to update the model for every added damper.

                Meal events at my college are highly sought after. Event booking comes online at 8am which is inconvenient. If I am
                awake, there is no guarantee of a space, as there are only 200 available and over 600 students vying for them.
                <br>
                To combat this, I created a fully automated bot (first using selenium browser automation and then using network requests),
                which runs from AWS Lambda cloud service. I also used parallel processing so I could handle booking my friends in too.
                A sequential approach may have taken too long and led to the last few people missing out.

                In this project I was introduced to control theory and C++ programming. The project focused on simulating the dynamics of a space probe
                orbiting and then landing on Mars. To simulate the mechanics of the system I made use of Euler and Verlet numerical integrators in combination 
                with Newton's laws. Landing the probe required the creation of autopilot capabilities. To do so I used proportional control of the throttle 
                and algorithmic logic as a means to control descent velocity, thereby safely land the probe.

                Although this assignment appeared to be about the final product output, in reality it was about using a strategy/framework for designing solutions 
                to complex issues. In brief, this framework involved problem exploration, concept generation, concept development and concept evaluation. In 
                addition to this I created a functional decomposition, cost analysis, material selection and requirements list for my developed concept.
